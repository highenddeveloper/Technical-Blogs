# Is Html an Programming language?

First of all hands off to those who think HTML is a programming language.

My reaction will be like this:

Ok so now jokes apart, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language, not a programming language. HTML is used to structure and format the content of web pages. It consists of a series of elements, each represented by a tag, that describes the structure and content of the page.

HTML is not a programming language because it cannot perform tasks or manipulate data. Instead, it is used to define the structure and content of a document and is typically used in conjunction with a programming language such as JavaScript, which is used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages.

Here is an example of an HTML document:

This is a simple example of an HTML document.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <p>This is a simple example of an HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `<!DOCTYPE html>` the declaration specifies that this is an HTML document, and the `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` Tags are used to structure the content of the page. The `<title>` Tag specifies the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab, and the `<h1>` and `<p>` Tags are used to mark up the main heading and paragraph of the page, respectively.

When an HTML document is rendered in a web browser, the browser reads the HTML tags and uses them to display the content of the page in a structured and formatted way.

### So now you thinking what gives logic to the webpage?

**You guessed it right!**

Now, **JavaScript** is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages. It is an object-oriented language that is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to build dynamic and responsive websites. It adds logic and makes the website responsive. There are many other features and capabilities of JavaScript, including the ability to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, and communicate with servers and databases. JavaScript is a powerful and widely used language that is essential for building interactive and dynamic web applications.

Well, this is not a javascript blog so stay tuned for javascript content..........
